# Static Site Generator

Created as part of the [boot.dev](https://www.boot.dev/tracks/backend) backend developer curriculum. This was a project to build a static site generator from scratch, taking raw content files like images and Markdown and converting them into HTML and CSS.

The overall structure and flow was guided, all unit testing and function implementations were left mostly up for interpretation as an exercise.
